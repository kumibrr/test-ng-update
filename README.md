# TestNgUpdate

This repo is a experiment of a rolling update from v6.2.9 at the time of v18.2.4 following [the Angular update guide](https://angular.dev/update-guide) to see what errors I encounter.

# From v6.2.9 to v7.2.16
ran `NG_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1 npx @angular/cli@7 update @angular/cli@7 @angular/core@7`

> The update went smooth. No errors at all
